        <h3>ü§ñ AI Research & Experimentation</h3>
        <p>
          I love exploring cutting-edge AI research papers and implementing new
          algorithms. Staying up-to-date with the latest developments in machine
          learning and neural networks is both a hobby and a professional
          passion. I enjoy experimenting with different model architectures and
          contributing to open-source AI projects.
